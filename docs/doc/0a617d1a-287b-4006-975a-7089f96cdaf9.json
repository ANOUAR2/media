These correspond to the first three columns in the dataset's metadata TSV file.\n```bash\nwget https://openaipublic.azureedge.net/clip/data/yfcc100m_subset_data.tsv.bz2\nbunzip2 yfcc100m_subset_data.tsv.bz2\n```\nUse of the underlying media files is subject to the Creative Commons licenses chosen by their creators/uploaders.
