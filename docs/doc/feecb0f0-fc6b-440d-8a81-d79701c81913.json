To do so, we filtered the YFCC100m dataset that have GPS coordinate corresponding to a [ISO-3166 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) and created a balanced dataset by sampling 150 train images, 50 validation images, and 100 test images images for each country.\nThe following command will download an 11GB archive countaining the images and extract into a subdirectory `country211`:\n```bash\nwget https://openaipublic.azureedge.net/clip/data/country211.tgz\ntar zxvf country211.tgz\n```\nThese images are a subset of the YFCC100m dataset.
