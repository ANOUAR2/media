To do so, we rendered the sentences in the [Standford Sentiment Treebank v2](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html) dataset and used those as the input to the CLIP image encoder.\nThe following command will download a 131MB archive countaining the images and extract into a subdirectory `rendered-sst2`:\n```bash\nwget https://openaipublic.azureedge.net/clip/data/rendered-sst2.tgz\ntar zxvf rendered-sst2.tgz\n```"
